    <h2 class="food">
      I love eating out!!!! Not just me my whole family we are big foodies, we
      love trying out new resturants. If there is a new resturant that has
      opened we are there!!!!! We are by ethinicity Indians, but we love trying
      everything, lebanese, chinese, afghani, you name it we have probarbly
      tried it. We are not the fine dining kind of people, we love trying food
      trucks or local resturants.

          One of our favorite cuisine to eat is middle eastern cuisine. I love
          the shawarma, there is a unique dish from the middle east that me and
          my kids love and its easy to make at home too. it's Muttabaq it is a
          mixture of groud beef, eggs, and spring onions all wrapped in a thin
          layer of dough, makes for an awesome breakfast.

          Next runner up is close to home, Indian cuisine. Although, we eat
          indian food almost everyday. When me and my family go out to eat we
          love to eat Hyderabadi mutton biryani. With the biryani there are so
          many variations of it, there is biryani for just about everthing there
          is prawns biryani, fish biryani, paneer(a sort of indian cottege
          cheese) biryani. While it does take some to cook and it does have
          numerous steps to the final product, but it is definitely worth it. If
          you are attemping to make it at home always remember "less is more".

        <p>
          Last but most definitely not the least, would have to be chinese
          cuisine. I personally love sushi, I love smoked salmon sushi. My
          family on the other hand do not approve of it. If there is something
          we love as a family it would have to be orange chicken. Similar to
          indian cusine if you decide to make it home, it is a bit cumbersome,
          but none the less worth it all the way.
