    <h1 class="lei">My favorite things to do in my leisure time.</h1>
    <h2 class="reset">
      When I'm not running around after my kids like a chicken with its head cut
      off!!!! So I guess you can say when I get the time. With that said, I love
      doing things that help me to hit the reset button. I guess you can say
      meditative activities or self soothing activities. Because honestly, who
      has time/place to do yoga especially when you have 4 kids you are lucky
      you get time to go to the bathroom in peace.

      <div class="walk">
        <p>
          Number one of my list would have to be hiking or taking long walks,
          just to get my head together, to gather my thoughts and to sort of
          destress. Or one can say mentally declutter, I love to see the nature
          while I'm walking and breathe in the fresh air, the smell of fresh dew
          early in the morning and hearing the nature around you calms you and
          takes all the stress out in a diffrent way.

      <div class="cake">
        <p>
          My next favorite thing to do is baking. For me baking is a very
          self-soothing activity, I have loved baking for a long time I am not
          like master chef level, but I do love to create new things. Usually
          when I'm too stressed out I just go into the kitchen see what I have
          that I can bake and create something new, that kind of helps me to
          destress. The thing I love apart of baking is decorating the things
          that I have baked, it is a diffrent kind of satisfaction when you
          decorate cookies and cakes. This is a picture of unicorn cake I
          attemped to make for my daughter's birthday.

      <div class="drive">
        <p>
          Lastly, I love going on long drives either by my self or with someone
          else . There is an odd satisfaction that you get when take a long
          drive into thick wooded areas with the trees and the fresh smell of
          pine cones and greenery around you, its the best way to spend a day
          off from work or school or kids for that mattter. Me personally, I
          love driving to Pennsylvania( given there is not traffic, if there
          something I hate more than anything its sitting through traffic!!!!!).
          Pennsylvania has some really nice scenery, hilly areas and thick
          greenery areas as you drive by it feels so serene.
