    My favorite places to visit.

<h2>
    I love going places with my family, we love exploring places and with my kids they love planning the trip more than actually going on the trip!!!!

    Our first stop for vacation is Istanbul, turkey, they have awesome food, awesome scenery, the strongest coffee in the world, so you dont get tired from all the fun you are having!!!. Whats not to like!!!! I love this place, its got so much history behind everthing, not just their monuments and buildings, even their food is rich in history.

    Our next desination is right here in USA, the city that never sleeps. NYC is the place to visit during the Holidays, Even though it is below freezing but the scenery is beautiful. there is a specail kind of magic in the air in NYC during the holidays and its not like anything you would have experinced before. Most awesome thing I would say is counting down time for the ball drop for New Years in Times Square!!!!!
