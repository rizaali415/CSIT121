          Our first stop for vacation is Istanbul, turkey, they have awesome
          food, awesome scenery, the strongest coffee in the world, so you dont
          get tired from all the fun you are having!!!. Whats not to like!!!! I
          love this place, its got so much history behind everthing, not just
          their monuments and buildings, even their food is rich in history.

          Next stop is Paris, France, The only place where love is in the air.
          Paris is the destination for all things love and beauty and ofcourse
          food. Just love the pastries and crossiants and their adorable
          deserts, they are so cute you almost dont want to eat them!!!

      <div class="NYC">
        <p>
          Our next desination is right here in USA, the city that never sleeps.
          NYC is the place to visit during the Holidays, Even though it is below
          freezing but the scenery is beautiful. there is a specail kind of
          magic in the air in NYC during the holidays and its not like anything
          you would have experinced before. Most awesome thing I would say is
          counting down time for the ball drop for New Years in Times
          Square!!!!!
